**Yes — but only in a very controlled, lightweight form.**
This is important to be precise about.

## What MediFlow *DOES* Have (Allowed)

### ✅ Patient Medical History (Lightweight, Non-Clinical)

MediFlow stores **historical visit context**, not a full medical record.

**Included:**

* Visit history timeline per patient
* For each visit:

  * Date & department
  * Attending doctor
  * Free-text consultation notes
  * Free-text prescription notes
  * Attached files (PDFs, scans, external lab results)
  * Discharge summary (PDF – Phase 2)

This allows:

* Doctors to see *past encounters*
* Operational continuity
* Realistic day-to-day hospital usage

---

## What MediFlow *DOES NOT* Have (Explicitly Excluded)

### ❌ No Structured Clinical History

MediFlow does **not** store:

* Diagnoses (coded or structured)
* ICD / CPT / SNOMED codes
* Problem lists
* Allergies database
* Medication history with drug intelligence
* Clinical timelines or condition tracking
* Treatment plans or outcomes analysis

All medical information is:

* **Text-based**
* **Clinician-entered**
* **Non-interpreted**
* **Non-decision-supporting**

---

## How This Should Be Described in the System

### Correct Terminology to Use

* “Visit history”
* “Consultation notes”
* “Encounter records”
* “Operational medical notes”

### Terminology to Avoid

* “Medical history” (alone)
* “Patient record” (without qualifier)
* “EMR / EHR”
* “Clinical record system”

## Canonical Definition (You Can Paste This Into Docs / README)

> **Patient History in MediFlow**
> MediFlow maintains a chronological history of patient visits, including clinician-entered notes, prescriptions (text only), attachments, and discharge summaries.
>
> It does not model diagnoses, conditions, or clinical decisions and does not function as a certified EMR or EHR system.

---

## Why This Is the Right Balance

* Real hospitals **need history visibility**
* Operations software **must show past visits**
* But crossing into structured medical modeling:

  * Raises regulatory concerns
  * Explodes scope
  * Undermines credibility

This design keeps MediFlow:

* Realistic
* Defensible
* Buildable
* Interview-safe

---

### Bottom line

✔ **Yes**, there is patient visit history
❌ **No**, there is no full medical or diagnostic history system

If you want next, I can:

* Define the **exact data model** for patient history
* Write the **UI copy** that avoids clinical wording
* Or define **access rules** (who can see past notes)

Just say the word.
